# AI-Powered Chatbot

## Project Overview

The AI-Powered Chatbot is a web application that simulates human-like conversation by leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Built using **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend, this chatbot integrates the **OpenAI GPT API** to process and generate responses to user queries in natural language. The project aims to showcase how modern AI can be integrated into web applications to provide interactive and intelligent user experiences.

This chatbot can be utilized in various scenarios, such as customer service, virtual assistants, or educational tools, demonstrating the versatility and power of AI in handling real-time user interactions.

## Features

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- The core feature of the chatbot is its ability to understand and respond to user inputs in natural language. This is powered by **OpenAI's GPT**, a state-of-the-art language model capable of generating human-like text based on the input it receives.

### Real-Time Interaction
- The chatbot provides real-time responses to user queries, creating a smooth and dynamic conversational experience. Users can interact with the chatbot without any noticeable delay, making it feel more responsive and engaging.

### User Authentication
- For projects that require user management, the chatbot includes an optional feature to implement **JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication**. This ensures that only authenticated users can access certain functionalities, adding a layer of security to the application.

### Persistent Chat History
- The application can be configured to store chat history in a database such as **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL**. This feature is particularly useful for scenarios where maintaining a record of conversations is important, such as customer support or user behavior analysis.
