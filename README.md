# AI-Powered Chatbot

## Project Overview

I developed the AI-Powered Chatbot as a web application to simulate human-like conversations using advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. The project was designed to enhance my experience with Generative AI and showcase how modern AI technologies can be integrated into web applications to create intelligent, user-friendly experiences. The frontend is built using React, while the backend leverages Node.js and integrates the OpenAI GPT API to generate natural language responses.

This chatbot can be used in various scenarios, such as customer service, virtual assistants, or educational tools, highlighting the effectiveness of AI in handling real-time user interactions.

## Features

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- The chatbot utilizes OpenAIâ€™s GPT, a powerful language model that processes user inputs in natural language and generates human-like responses.

### Real-Time Interaction

- The chatbot offers real-time responses with minimal delay, ensuring smooth and engaging conversations.

### User Authentication

- JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication is implemented to ensure that only authenticated users can access specific features, enhancing the application's security.

### Persistent Chat History

- Conversations are stored in a Heroku PostgreSQL database, enabling the tracking and analysis of user interactions. This is especially useful for applications that require a record of chat history, such as customer support.

### Topic Continuity

- The chatbot maintains conversation context across multiple exchanges, allowing users to ask follow-up questions and receive responses that build on previous interactions.

### Conversation Context Management

- The chatbot uses chat logs from previous interactions to deliver relevant and coherent responses in ongoing conversations.

### Error Handling

- The system is designed to handle errors smoothly, providing users with informative feedback in case of invalid inputs or system issues.

### User-Friendly Interface

- The chatbot offers a clean, intuitive design that makes it easy for both registered and unregistered users to interact with the system.

### Scalable Backend

- The application is hosted on Heroku, allowing for scalable and reliable cloud-based performance.

### Responsive UI

- The user interface is built with React and is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience across platforms.
