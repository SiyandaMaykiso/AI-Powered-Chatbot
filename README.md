# AI-Powered Chatbot

## Project Overview

I developed the AI-Powered Chatbot as a web application to simulate human-like conversation using advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. I built the frontend with React and the backend with Node.js, integrating the OpenAI GPT API to process and generate responses to user queries in natural language. My goal with this project is to showcase how modern AI can be seamlessly integrated into web applications to create interactive and intelligent user experiences.

This chatbot can be applied in various scenarios, such as customer service, virtual assistants, or educational tools, demonstrating the versatility and power of AI in managing real-time user interactions.

## Features

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- The core feature of my chatbot is its ability to understand and respond to user inputs in natural language. This is made possible by OpenAI's GPT, a state-of-the-art language model that generates human-like text based on the input it receives.

### Real-Time Interaction
- My chatbot provides real-time responses to user queries, creating a smooth and dynamic conversational experience. Users can interact with the chatbot without any noticeable delay, making the experience feel more responsive and engaging.

### User Authentication
- For projects requiring user management, I've included an optional feature to implement JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. This ensures that only authenticated users can access certain functionalities, adding an extra layer of security to the application.

### Persistent Chat History
- I configured the application to store chat history in a Heroku PostgreSQL database. This feature is particularly useful for scenarios where maintaining a record of conversations is important, such as customer support or user behavior analysis.
